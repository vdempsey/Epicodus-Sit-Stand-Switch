# Sit-Stand-Switch
_Epicodus capstone project (work in progress)_

### Current state (Feb 1st 2018)
User can click and navigate through the menu under the main banner.
User can register (Plus sign will have future functionality to add image)
User can view his/her profile page (currently navigation bar under the banner is a clone of splash navigation with updated names for links). The profile image is hard coded for now. Working on updating it based on user's input.

Planning on refactoring css and components.

##### Clone project directions:

1. $ git clone url-project-name
2. $ cd project-name
3. $ npm install
4. $ npm run start
