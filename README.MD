_Epicodus capstone project (work in progress). Built in React._

### Target Audience:
Users of Sit-Stand workstations.
### Goal:

To remind users to switch position throughout the day by creating a sit-stand schedule, build accountability by teaming up with co-workers (one is sitting, one is standing, then switch)

### User Stories:
